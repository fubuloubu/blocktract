*Building Block Based Smart Contract Language*

----

blocktract is a python-based langauge aimed at using snippets of code, aka "building blocks",
to compose fully-featured and safe smart contracts in readable, structured text

By building smart contracts from "blocks" of different types of functionality that do not interoperate
or directly inherit in any way, blocktrack promotes clear and concise programming practices that are
easily verifiable using standard and formal verification methods. This promotes overall code fitness
and stability.

By targeting structured text, blocktract aims to allow building documentation directly from the source files,
thereby enhanced integration with overall content design practices in order to make smart contracts more transparent.
